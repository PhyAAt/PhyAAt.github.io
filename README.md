# Jekyll Port of phyaat.github.io

1. Dependncy installation
https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/

2. Previewing site locally
`jekyll serve`
127.0.0.1:4000

3. Creating a new page:
I have added a new page: `new.md`.
`http://127.0.0.1:4000/new` or
`http://127.0.0.1:4000/new.html`

4. Issues:
+ authors.html: Chaging it to authors.md is messing the layout.
Maybe some tags are unbalances.

+ Cleaning up directory: All the pages now are at root dir.
