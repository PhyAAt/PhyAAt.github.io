# Removing artifact using ATAR algorithm
In this notebook, we demonstrate that how we can apply ATAR algorithm built in spkit, whcih is combined with phyaat library now. The objective of including ATAR with phyaat is
to make an easy to apply on phyaat dataset to quickly built a model for prediction task.
